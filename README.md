# Global Energy EDA

This project uses a publicly available dataset that documents global energy generation and usage spanning over a century (as early as the 1900). Energy sources tracked in this dataset include; Biofuel energy, Solar energy Electrical energy, Gas energy, Wind energy, etc. However, for the purpose of this project, only three energy sources were considered; Biofuel, Solar and Electrical energy. Each of these sources was explored across documented countries/ region.
